Dr. Rain is a application that checks tomorrow's weather and emails people
if the probability of rain in their area is higher than a given threshhold.

To run the script, see `check_weather.py`

The app relies on a configuration file outlined in `dr_rain_configs.py`. The
configuration file should be located in the root directory at dr_rain.ini
